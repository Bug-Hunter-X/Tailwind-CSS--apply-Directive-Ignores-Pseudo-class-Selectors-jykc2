This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-class selector like `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive only applies the styles for the base class and ignores the pseudo-class styles. For example:

```css
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
}

.btn:hover {
  @apply bg-blue-700;
}
```

In this case, `@apply bg-blue-700` within the `:hover` pseudo-class will be ignored by the `@apply` directive, causing the hover effect not to work as expected.
